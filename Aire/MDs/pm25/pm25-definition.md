## Particulate Matter 2.5 is a mix of solid and liquid substances that are generally 2.5 micrometers or smaller.

In other words, **28 times smaller than a human hair**. Their size allows them to stay in the air for long periods of time and travel for very long distances. They're so small that they can actually enter the lungs.
