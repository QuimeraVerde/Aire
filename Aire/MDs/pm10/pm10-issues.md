## The particles are so small they can behave like gas particles.

Effects on human health:
● Reduced lung function
● Respiratory diseases
● Asthma attacks
● Premature death of people with lung disease
● Heart attacks
● Pregnancy complications

Several studies state that exposure to these particles can **increase mortality** and hospital admissions. An increase of these particles in the air can lead to an increase in cases of lung cancer.
