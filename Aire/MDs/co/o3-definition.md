## Ozone is a highly reactive gas that is formed naturally by sunlight and oxygen.

It can be found in two layers of the atmosphere:

● The layer closest to earth (troposphere): ozone is considered a pollutant in this layer and has effects on health

● Ozone layer: ozone works as a solar filter in this layer and protects earth from UV rays
