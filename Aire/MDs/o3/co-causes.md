## Carbon monoxide is released whenever something is burnt.

It can be generated by different modes of transportation due to the burn of:
● Gas
● Petroleum
● Gasoline

Stovetops, grills, and heaters are also main sources of carbon monoxide, since they include burning of fuels and can affect air quality **inside households**. Smelting facilities, paper production, and mining are main industrial sources.
